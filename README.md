# FinalProjectJava

This program can be used to store data about students, teachers and employee at a school/university (though it's not saved so everytime you close the program all the data is lost).
This program utilizes GUI layout manager by importing swing. The program is meant to be ran from the MainMenu.java file. When the program is ran, there will be a window with buttons to add people (could be student, teacher, or employee) into the table.
Clicking a button will open up another window. For example, clicking "View Employee" will bring a window showing a table of employees. At the beginning everything is empty, so the user have to fill the data themselves.

Unfortunately saving the data into the local machine is not implemented yet (I don't think I have the time to implement it), so the program can't really be used beneficially.
